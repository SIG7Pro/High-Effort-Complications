This mod was initially planned to be a decimation of the entire game, but $MAINDEV
has decided to pull a Schr√∂dinger's 180, and mix it with other mods.

This mod is not made in Kade Engine, because:
1. $MAINDEV is a masochist
2. This mod started development before Kade Engine started picking up popularity
3. Kade Engine is for pussies

However, various Kade Engine features have been added:
- Dialogue       (system based off of FNF Restored)
- Double framerate (will be added in final version)
- Downscroll
- Song time

Added features:
- ZXBN keybinds
- Open notes
- Basic options menu
- Rich Presence  (wasn't on the base repo at the time of download)
- Y difficulty      (an experience that isn't allowed in Freeplay)
                    !!!!      (work needed on *almost every song*)
